title: Building Immersive Web Experiences with x3dom and WebXR
---

Virtual Reality (VR) is an exciting technology that allows users to immerse themselves in a computer-generated environment. With the advancement of WebXR APIs, developers can now create immersive web experiences using browsers that support these APIs. I had been provided with an opportunity this year to work on the feature of integrating WebXR to x3dom open-source library.

[x3dom](https://www.x3dom.org/) is a web-based toolkit that allows developers to integrate 3D content into webpages. By combining x3dom with WebXR APIs, we can create immersive experiences that are accessible through any browser that supports these APIs.

The project involves implementing features such as navigation and multiple viewpoints in VR mode. Navigation is an essential feature that allows users to move around in the virtual environment, and multiple viewpoints enable them to see the same object from different angles. By combining these features, we can create a more engaging and interactive experience for users. More details about my contribution could be found in this [wiki](https://github.com/rghv96/x3dom/wiki/WebXR-Changes) .

Here are some [samples](https://metagrid1.sv.vt.edu/~raghavsethi/). You may need a VR headset or a browser extension to try VR mode; the details have been provided in the wiki. The samples have been developed by students working in [Advanced Research Computing - Visionarium, Virginia Tech](https://arc.vt.edu/services/visualization/visionarium.html).

Update: Oct 2023. The work was accepted in Web3D SIGGRAPH 2023 Conference which was held in San Sebastian, Spain. [Integrating XR Content in X3DOM: Supporting Navigation and Custom Functions in X3D Scenes](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3611314.3615918)
