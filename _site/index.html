      <h1><a href="/x3dom/">Building Immersive Web Experiences with x3dom and WebXR</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is an exciting technology that allows users to immerse themselves in a computer-generated environment. With the advancement of WebXR APIs, developers can now create immersive web experiences using browsers that support these APIs. I had been provided with an opportunity this year to work on the feature of integrating WebXR to x3dom open-source library.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>There has been a rapid advancement in AI technology that has led to it being able to generate art, music, and even full-length movies. With the increasing market and industry impact of AI-generated content, it has become necessary to consider the ethical implications of content ownership in this context.</p>

      <h1><a href="/ETDSearchEngine/">Building a Search Engine for Electronic Thesis</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Academic institutions the world over are known to produce hundreds of thousands of ETDs (Electronic Theses and Dissertations) every year. At the end of an academic year, we are left with large volumes of ETD data that are rarely used for further research or ever cited in future work, writings, or publications. As part of the CS5604: Information Storage and Retrieval graduate-level course at Virginia Tech, we collectively created a search engine for a collection of more than 500,000 ETDs from academic institutions in the United States, which constitutes the class-wide project.</p>

      <h1><a href="/Covid19ResearchDataset/">Uncovering Insights from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset using Data Analytics</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic had brought the world to a standstill, and researchers had been working tirelessly to find a cure for this infectious disease. With the rapid acceleration in coronavirus literature, it had become increasingly difficult for the medical research community to keep up. To address this issue, I developed an interactive COVID-19 literature clustering solution using t-SNE, PCA, and K-means algorithm to group similar research articles.</p>

      <h1><a href="/Type2learn/">Type2Learn - My first Chrome Extension</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I am a big fan of productivity tools and always wanted to build a chrome extension. The browser extensions are really powerful as you can run almost arbitrary Javascript over the DOM of any webpage. I had enjoyed practicing touch typing and racing with my friends online. Hitting two birds with one stone, I created <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/type2learn/fhaenfmnpmhafnbamailokcjjbpmehig?ref=producthunt">Type2Learn</a>  - a browswer extension to practice touch typing and concentrate on your webpage. You can monitor your speed, errors you make, and accuracy in real-time!</p>

      <h1><a href="/Extensions/">Extensions i ❤️</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Over the years I have discovered some cool and useful browser extensions which help me be more productive both on and off work. I used to use Google Chrome but after being tired of its high memory usage I switched to <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> - a chromium browser. These extensions work on Chrome and Chromium browsers and should be avalaible for other browsers also.</p>

      <h1><a href="/BIOGAN/">Translating Biometric Data - Improving Biometric Authentication with Generative Adversarial Networks</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Biometric authentication has become increasingly prevalent in modern security systems, but there are still limitations in terms of accuracy and reliability. One major challenge is the quality of the biometric data itself, which can be affected by various factors such as sensor lens issues or algorithm training. As part of my undergrad thesis at IIT Mandi, I worked on a solution using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve the quality of biometric data.</p>

      <h1><a href="/IITPipeDriver/">IITPipe Driver - Building a Custom Kernel Module for Delayed Piping</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Piping is a powerful feature in Unix-like operating systems that allows programs to communicate with each other, passing data from the output of one program to the input of another. However, standard piping is instantaneous, with no delay between the two programs. This can lead to issues if the programs require a delay between them, such as for synchronization or testing purposes. To address this issue, we have implemented a custom kernel module, IITPipe Driver, which provides delayed piping capabilities.</p>

        <p>Facebook Messenger is one of the most popular messaging platforms with millions of active users. In recent years, businesses and individuals have started to use chatbots to automate their communication with customers and friends.

      <h1><a href="/3DHolographicProjector/">Revolutionizing Visualizations with 3D Holographic Projector</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Have you ever found it difficult to analyse and visualise 3D objects in a 2D plane? Do you wish to see dynamic movements of 3D objects in real-time? If yes, then a 3D holographic projector could be the solution to your problem. Holographic projection of objects around us can create easy visualisation of models that can be used in education fields like architecture and modelling softwares like SolidWorks, Autocad, etc. Although there are solutions available in the market, they are either too sophisticated or too expensive. Hence, we aim to build a 3D holographic projector that can revolutionize the way we visualise 3D objects.</p>
