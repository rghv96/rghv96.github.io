title: Type2Learn - My first Chrome Extension
---

I am a big fan of productivity tools and always wanted to build a chrome extension. The browswer extensions are really powerful as you can run almost arbitrary Javascript over the DOM of any webpage. I had enjoyed practicing touch typing and racing with my friends online. Hitting two birds with one stone, I created [Type2Learn](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/type2learn/fhaenfmnpmhafnbamailokcjjbpmehig?ref=producthunt)  - a browswer extension to practice touch typing and concentrate on your webpage. You can monitor your speed, errors you make, and accuracy in real-time!

I took some time to launch it as I wanted to create an easy user experience which I believe still can be improved. I launched the extension on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/type2learn-chrome-extension) and posted on online forums to attract some users. It has got 40+ installs across the globe. Do check it out!
