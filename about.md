I am a CS grad student at Virginia Tech, US. Prior to this, I was working as a Software Engineer and have a total of four years of experience working in India and Singapore. I am passionate about developing intriguing softwares that uses technology to fulfill human needs. I pursued research in Deep Learning during my final year at university. Feel free to contact me for my resume.

I love playing Badminton and Table Tennis and occasionally go for a run.

In order to get my creative juice flowing, I sometimes play guitar and read [books](https://www.goodreads.com/rghv96).
