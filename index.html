        I am a final year Computer Science Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi. I am very passionate about developing intriguing softwares that uses technology to fulfill human needs. I am looking forward to opportunities where I can use my theoretical knowledge and put it into more practical use. Here's my <a href="raghav_sethi.pdf">resume</a>.

      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Software Developer Intern, Nucleus Software Export Ltd.</strong><br>
        As a software developer intern I built a web application to store sensitive data securely following the requirements of PCI-DSS. Exact search and range queries were also tested on the data. 
      </p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>BIOGAN: Generating synthetic iris and fingerprint images</strong><br>
        This is my ongoing Major Technical Project in which I have to design a Generativ Adversarial Network that can generate large quantity of high quality iris and fingerprint images and develop a masterprint to spoof biometric systems.

      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Concept Lattice using Titan Graph Database</strong><br>
        Stored and queried a Concept Lattice stored in Titan distributed Graph Database. Used Hadoop and HBase at the storage backend
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>iitpipe Driver</strong><br>
        Implemented pipe by building a Kernel Module to pipe two programs with delay. Measured performance of the pipe by using different delay and buffer sizes
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Facebook Messenger Quotebot</strong><br>
        Built an automated messenger bot that can respond with quotes and images to keywords by user. Used Facebook Send/Receive API and Flask python framework for web request handling

      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>3D Holographic Projector</strong><br>
        Created a product which displayed 3D-projections inside a glass
        pyramid that can be manipulated by hand gestures. Solved the problem of 3D visualization through the product using leap motion technology. This project won 3rd prize at the college level Design Practicum Open House.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Medical Record Automation</strong><br>
         Developed a web portal that enabled patients to book appointments
         online and retrieve medical records. Accessed information that was stored in a MySQL database
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Password Based Door Lock System</strong><br>
         Implemented a model in which a person has to enter correct pin in a keypad which then powers a motor connected to Arduino to unlock the door. Option to change the password was provided.
